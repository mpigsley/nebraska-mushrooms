##### How to

This website allows you to see lists of mushrooms organized by where they are found in Nebraska parks. Links from the below identification key will direct you to different lists of mushrooms that have been surveyed in Nebraska parks. For more advanced queries, please see [technical details](#technical-details).

##### Key to Major Forms

To identify a mushroom, start here. Does your mushroom match the form? If so, click on the "list" link. If it doesn't continue on down the list. If you can't find the form of your mushroom, please look in "non-typical" forms.

**Gilled Mushrooms. aka Agarics**

These mushrooms typically have a stem that raises the cap above the substrate. Underneath the cap are a multitude of flat plates called "gills" that radiate from the stem outwards to the cap margin. The surface of these plates generate spores which promote the reproductive cycle of the mushroom species.

**Boletes** 

These mushrooms have a cap and stem and are generally soft, stout, and fleshy. Underneath the cap is a layer of tubes that can be easily separated from the cap.

##### Edibility

**Important**: Please read the article [Concerning Edibility](/articles/concerning-wild-mushroom-edibility/) before using this website.

* [Edible](/location/indian-cave-state-park/?q=tag:edible)

##### Technical Details

This website allows you to see lists of mushrooms organized by where they are found in [Nebraska Parks](/location).

The list interface allows you to filter the results using any custom search words along with "tags". "Tags" are a method of grouping species into different buckets like what season they are found in, what they look like, edibility, toxicity, etc.

For example, if you're interested in gilled mushrooms from Indian Cave State Park, simply select the “agaric” tag to see the [list of agarics surveyed](/location/indian-cave-state-park/?q=tag:agaric)
