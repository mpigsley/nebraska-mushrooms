##### How to use this website

This website allows you to see lists of mushrooms organized by where they are found in [Nebraska Parks](/location).

The list interface allows you to filter the results using any custom search words along with **tags**. Tags are a method of grouping species into different buckets like what season they are found in, what they look like, edibility, toxicity, etc.

##### Major Fungi Form  Tags

If you're interested in gilled mushrooms from Indian Cave State Park, simply select the **agaric tag** to see the [list of agarics surveyed](/location/indian-cave-state-park/?q=tag:agaric). See more form tags in the [Key](/articles/key)
