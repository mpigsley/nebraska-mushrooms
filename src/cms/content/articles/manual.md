#### Purpose

The goal of the Nebraska Mushrooms project is to document mushrooms found in Nebraska parks and provide tools to easily search our database. This project is an active work in progress and should in no way be considered a complete perspective of the biodiversity of the state, which is much larger commonly suspected.

The database may be searched from [here](/location/all).

#### Tags

You can filter the results of the database using **tags**. Tags are a way of grouping species into different buckets. Such as what season they are found in, what they look like, edibility, toxicity, etc. Tags can be combined to fine tune results.

Tags can take the form of:
- [Season](#season-tags)
- [Edibility](#edibility-tags)
- [Form](#form-tags)
- [Substrate](#substrate-tags)

For example, if you'd like to see the gilled mushrooms that grow in woodland duff in the spring, you could combine the `agaric`, `substrate-duff`, and `spring` tags.
