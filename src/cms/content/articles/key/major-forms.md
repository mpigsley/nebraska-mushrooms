        <p>Classifying fungi is like trying to draw sharp lines in a watercolor wash. We humans can attempt to fit them neatly in boxes, though nature isn't structured that way. Inevitably, there are paradoxes, contradictions, exceptions, and overlap that we must account for. In <em>Opticks</em> (1704), Isaac Newton performed his famous prism experiment and noticed the rainbow cast by the prism divided light into seven distinct colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. It was later pointed out by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in <em>Zur Farbenlehre (Theory of Colours)</em> (1810) that no distinct colors exist, but rather a continuous gradient of color. The human-factor is essential to making the process of observing the light spectrum intelligible, but there is something else much more innate and beautiful at work that 'muds-up' the simplistic perspective.</p>
        <p>Biological nature is the same way. It is not clean and organized into distinct nameable objects, but rather a gradient of evolution and fallout from all genetic possibilities that 'worked' throughout time. That doesn't stop us humans from attempting to categorize the mess into clean slices. The process of categorization is completely necessary to generate a useful key for identification. For this key, an effort has been made to divide <em>most</em> of what would be found in nature into twelve general slices. These slices can then be divided further and further in other keys to hopefully come to a satisfying identification to species, though possibly not, as general keys aren't comprehensive. Identification to genus or family may be all the same degree of satisfaction. The mycologist must always keep in mind that which we have not found (especially in North America), which contradictions may exist in the biological gradient, and maintain a healthy skepticism of what we think we know.</p>
        <p>This key is not a traditional dichotomous key (two-choice key), but rather a sunburst or wheel. This design is heavily inspired by the publication Fungi of Temperate Europe (T. Læssøe, J. Petersen), for which a free PDF of the identification wheels are available from <a href="https://www.mycokey.com/">MycoKey</a>. A multitude of photos is used to reduce the verbosity of text, because we as humans are naturally visual pattern seeking creatures (and many people scroll past text, anyway). Below the wheels are descriptions of the slices with links to other keys, taxa, and feature filters in our fungal database. Please also note that this key depends on forms and morphology rather than lineages, so this key does not represent evolutionary or taxonomic relationships. For that, we suggest using the <a href="/taxa/life/">Structured Species List</a>. Enjoy!</p>

    <p>
      • Umbrella-like object; Wearing a ‘hat’.
      <br>• Can be on a stem (stipitate) or attached directly to the substrate from which it is growing (sessile).<br>• 'Pileate' in Mycologese, or bearing a 'pileus'.
      <br>• Immensly diverse. Any different lineages have developed the cap through convergent evolution.

      <h4>Carbon Fungi</h4>
    <p>
      • On close inspection, surfaces possess small bumps with openings (perithecia). Some possess a "stem"-like structure (stroma) that raise the perithecia away from the substrate (commonly on wood).
      <br>• When young, the colors can be white, black, red, gray, or orange. With age, the fruiting bodies generally turn blackish and crack like coal, describing a more formal name Pyrenomycetous Fungi or Fire Fungi.
      <br><br>• Shapes range from:
      <br>👉 round (<a href="/taxa/daldinia">Daldinia</a>),

      <br>• In adult form, resemble morels at first glance, though the smell and the slimy apex of the stinkhorn makes them easy to seaprate.
      <br>• The gelatinous material is composed of small spores. Flies and other insects are attrated and are eventualy covered in numerous spores which they then dispurse in other locations.

      • Pathogens infecting leaves and fruits of many plant species.
      <br><br>• <b>Juniper-Apple Rust</b> (<i>Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae</i>) is the most commonly observed rust which creates a large ball on the cones of Eastern Redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) that grow large orange tentacles when wet. It also creates small dots on apple tree (genus Malus) leaves and has a lifecycle alternating between the two trees.
      <br>• <b>Corn Smut</b> (<i>Mycosarcoma maydis</i>) is the most commonly observed smut that infects corn cobs on the stalk and makes large gray and black growths. These growths are highly prised edibles in some cultures when gathered at the correct growth stage.
