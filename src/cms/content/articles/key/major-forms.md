Classifying fungi is like trying to draw sharp lines in a watercolor wash. We humans can attempt to fit them neatly in boxes, though nature isn't structured that way. Inevitably, there are paradoxes, contradictions, exceptions, and overlap that we must account for. In _Opticks_ (1704), Isaac Newton performed his famous prism experiment and noticed the rainbow cast by the prism divided light into seven distinct colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. It was later pointed out by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in _Zur Farbenlehre (Theory of Colours)_ (1810) that no distinct colors exist, but rather a continuous gradient of color. The human-factor is essential to making the process of observing the light spectrum intelligible, but there is something else much more innate and beautiful at work that 'muds-up' the simplistic perspective.

Biological nature is the same way. It is not clean and organized into distinct nameable objects, but rather a gradient of evolution and fallout from all genetic possibilities that 'worked' throughout time. That doesn't stop us humans from attempting to categorize the mess into clean slices. The process of categorization is completely necessary to generate a useful key for identification. For this key, an effort has been made to divide _most_ of what would be found in nature into twelve general slices. These slices can then be divided further and further in other keys to hopefully come to a satisfying identification to species, though possibly not, as general keys aren't comprehensive. Identification to genus or family may be all the same degree of satisfaction. The mycologist must always keep in mind that which we have not found (especially in North America), which contradictions may exist in the biological gradient, and maintain a healthy skepticism of what we think we know.

This is key is not a traditional dichotomous key (two-choice key), but rather a sunburst or wheel. This design is heavily inspired by the publication Fungi of Temperate Europe (T. Læssøe, J. Petersen), for which a free PDF of the identification wheels are available from [MycoKey](https://www.mycokey.com/). A multitude of photos is used to reduce the verbosity of text, because we as humans are naturally visual pattern seeking creatures (and many people scroll past text, anyway). Below the wheels are descriptions of the slices with links to other keys, taxa, and feature filters in our fungal database. Please also note that this key depends on forms and morphology rather than lineages, so this key does not represent evolutionary or taxonomic relationships. For that, we suggest using the [Structured Species List](/taxa/life/). Enjoy!

    <p>
      • Umbrella-like object; Wearing a ‘hat’.<br>
      • Can be on a stem (stipitate) or attached directly to the substrate from which it is growing (sessile).<br>
      • 'Pileate' in Mycologese, or bearing a 'pileus'.<br>
      <br>

    <p>
      • On close inspection, surfaces possess small bumps with openings (perithecia). Some possess a "stem"-like structure (stroma) that raise the perithecia away from the substrate (commonly on wood).
      <br>• When young, the colors can be white, black, red, gray, or orange. With age, the fruiting bodies generally turn blackish and crack like coal, describing a more formal name Pyrenomycetous Fungi or Fire Fungi.
      <br><br>• Shapes range from:
      <br>👉 round (<a href="/taxa/daldinia">Daldinia</a>), 
      <br>👉 club to antler-shaped (<a href="/taxa/xylaria">Xylaria</a>),

      <br>• Many unrelated fungi fit into this group. Some resemble polypores, some agaric-like, comb-like, and some look like beards!
      <br>• The spines are covered with microscopic reproductive cells that produce spores.

      • Fruiting body grows flat against its substrate (bark, barkless wood, twigs, etc.) utilizing the entire surface to reproduce spores. Formally known as the Corticioids.
      <br>• Some species grow a cap as well (known as effused-reflexed).
      <br>• Surfaces can be wrinkled, folded, smooth, worty, or toothed (if pored, it's considered a flat polypore)
