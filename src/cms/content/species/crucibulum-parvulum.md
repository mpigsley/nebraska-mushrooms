This bizarre decomposer is composed of a nest-like structure containing disc-like eggs, which are small spore sacks. This fungus has an interesting method of spore dispersal. The nest is structured so that it may catch falling raindrops which splash the eggs to other locations to seed future mycelium.

_Crucibulum parvulum_ can be found growing on twigs, woodchips, and roots east of the Rocky Mountains from summer through fall.

The Discrete Birds Nest is considered a smaller version of the Common Birds Nest (_Crucibulum laeve_). The former is described with a nest 1.5-3mm wide and the latter 4-10mm wide. Interestingly enough, this specimen seems to be bigger than described, but the DNA results matched _Crucibulum parvulum_... It seems that DNA testing might be necessary to accurately separate the two species.
