_Russula sp-IN14_ is a large mycorrhizal mushroom that can be found in the summer in woodland settings. This one was found in an Oak/Hickory woodland at Indian Cave State Park. It was found growing from soil near Ash, Shagbark Hickory, Bur Oak, and American Hop Hornbeam trees. It has a slightly acrid aftertaste and the cap leather will pull easily from the margin to 1/3 distance to the cap center. The tan cap features subtle notes of green and maroon.
