The Scaber Stem Agrocybe (_Agrocybe firma_) is a decomposer that grows on dead hardwood logs in wooded areas and can be found summer through fall. It is mostly distributed west of the Great Plains.

It has a dark, firm cap without lines at the margin. Gills that are narrowly attached to the stem that start white-colored then turn dull brown. The stem is distinctly ornamented with scale-like tufts of white fibrils that turn brown with age. Annulus and volva are absent. It can be found fruiting in clusters or, rarely, alone.
