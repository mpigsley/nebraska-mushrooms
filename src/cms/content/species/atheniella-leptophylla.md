The Eastern Tangerine Athena (_Atheniella leptophylla_) is a decomposer of duff and wood, and can be found in September in woodland areas. It is small, grows alone or in small groups, and has a `Mycenoid` stature, sharing features with the genus [Mycena](/taxa/mycena).

__Cap:__ convex or bell-shaped, and sometimes papillate (with a nipple-shaped umbo). The surface is smooth and presents a striped pattern when moist from the gills underneath (translucent-striate). It is pale reddish-yellow, brighter toward the center (disc), and becomes pleated at the margin with age.

__Gills:__ close, narrow, and attached to the stem with a decurrent tooth (uncinate), yellowish to whitish in color.

__Stem:__ slender, hollow, smooth at the apex and center with coarse fibrils towards the base.

__Spore Print:__ white.

__Etymology:__ *leptophylla* comes from the Greek roots *lepto-* meaning "slender" and *-phylla* meaning "leaf" or "gill," referring to its thin gills.
