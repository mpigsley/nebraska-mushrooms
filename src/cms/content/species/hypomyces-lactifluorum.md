The Lobster Mushroom (_Hypomyces lactifluorum_) is a parasite that infects other mushrooms, generally within the genuses [_Rusula_](/taxa/russula) and [_Lactarius_](/taxa/lactarius). It can be found in the summer through fall.

The host is infected at the time of fruiting body development, which changes the DNA expression of an otherwise white-colored, gilled mushroom into a contorted orange-pimpled form. The spore print is white. The spores are distinctly pointed on two ends.

An easy field test for this mushroom is to drop some dilute KOH on the flesh. It should result in dark purple.
