*Hebeloma albomarginatum* appears in soil in the fall in woodlands associating with broadleaf trees. The species name means “white-margined,” referring to the pale edge of the cap. It is distinguished from similar species by spore shape and the color of the cap, which is “Light Cinnamon Drab” except for the margin (Hesler, 1967).

The cap is convex, sticky when moist, and pale cinnamon-brown with a bright white outer edge. Its surface is finely fibrous. The gills are white when young, becoming brown with age, and are adnate to rounded-adnate with slightly ragged edges. The stem is white, slightly swollen at the base, and covered near the top with fine white scales. The flesh is firm and white, with a strong radish-like odor and a sharp, earthy taste. The spore print is brown.
