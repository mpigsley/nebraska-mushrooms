_Russula sp-IN1_ is a mycorrhizal mushroom that can be found in woodland settings in the summer. It has been reported growing in proximity to Northern Red Oak, Bur Oak, Chinkapin Oak, and Elm trees. It has a red cap that is viscid (slimy) when wet. The fruiting body may have a phenolic or chemical-like smell when fresh. The cap leather can be easily pulled from the margin to about 1/3 to the center without ripping. The gills white, attached to the stem, and spaced sub-distant.
