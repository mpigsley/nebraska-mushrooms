_Marasmius delectans_ is a decomposer of woody debris and woodland duff and can be found in the late summer through fall. It features a whitish pale-yellow cap with minute stripes or pleats. The stem offers a beautiful color transition from black, to dark red, to orange, whitish from the stem base to the stem apex. The gills are pale yellow and are attached to the stem and break free at maturity (seceding). The spore print is white.

An interesting microscopic feature of this mushroom are sterile shapes that can be found on the gills known as `broom cells`. These cells look like a bundle of fingers on the end of a knob that _sorta_ looks like a broom. Maybe someday we will learn what purpose (if any) these cells have. It has been suggested that non-reproductive cells on the gills are used as microscopic spacers between the gills to give the reproductive cells enough space to disperse spores without getting trapped.
