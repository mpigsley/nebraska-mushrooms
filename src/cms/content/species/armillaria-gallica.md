The White Honey Mushroom (_Armillaria gallica_) is a decomposer of wood and can be found in the fall. It has a widespread distribution in Eastern Nebraska from Indian Cave State Park to the Niobrara Valley Preserve (Mee-Sook & Klopfenstein, 2011). _A. gallica_ can be found in areas of dead trees decomposing wood and buried roots and is common in wooded areas and occasional lawns (decomposing tree roots).

The cap is ornamented with distinct scaly hairs that are more abundant toward the center of the stem as the mushroom matures.

The gill color is whitish. The gills are attached to the stem and sometimes have a short bit that runs down the stem (decurrent tooth).

This species has a high degree of color variation. The specimen below has a whiter base color with darker cap scales than the one above.

Fruiting bodies grow alone or in small clusters. The stem shape has an enlarged base (bulbous). It has a ring (annulus) that is cobwebby to membranous in composition. It does not have a cup at the base (volva). The spore print is white.
