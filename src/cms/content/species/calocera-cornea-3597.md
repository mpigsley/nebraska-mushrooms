The Club-like Tuning Fork is a decomposer that grows on wood. This specimen was found fruiting in the cracks of a chared Black Oak trunk. It is yellow to orange-colored and is tough and gelatinous (the same features are shared with many other Dacrymycetes). It can be found fruiting on Oaks and other broadleaf woods in the spring and fall.

Calocera furcata is similar, but fruits on conifer wood.
