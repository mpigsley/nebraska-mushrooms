_Russula sp-IN13_ is a mycorrhizal mushroom that can be found in the summer in woodland settings. It seems to fruit in clusters and has been reported growing adjacent to Bitternut Hickory, American Hophornbeam, Northern Red Oak, Ash, Chinkapin Oak, Elm, Eastern Red Cedar and Black Oak.

The caps are lumpy and yellow when fresh becoming lighter colored and cracked with age. The gills are serrated (finely saw-toothed) and fluoresce neon green under UV light. The whole mushroom seems to bruise brown or brownish-orange when handled. The taste is peppery/spicy (acrid).
