This is a parasitic fungus that attacks parasitic fungi. Yes, you read that right. This is a parasite on top of another parasite. This is a phenomenon known has 'hyperparasitism'. The host of this hyperparasite is [_Ophiocordyceps variabilis_](/species/ophiocordyceps-variabilis). It is presumed by some mycologists that hyperparasites are quite common, but rarely observed.

This specimen is new to science confirmed by its [DNA results](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/170023539) and has yet to be formally described.
