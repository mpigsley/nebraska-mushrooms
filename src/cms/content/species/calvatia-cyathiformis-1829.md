The Purple-spored Puffball is a grassland decomposer that can be found in summer through fall. It is a common mushroom widely distributed across the globe. It can be found alone, in groups, or in fairy rings.

*Calvatia cyathiformis* is generally pear-shaped to loaf-shaped. The exterior can be colored white to tan to brown and develops a "mud-cracked" pattern after being exposed to the sun. The interior begins white when young, transitioning to a purplish color towards the top and olive at the base when mature.
