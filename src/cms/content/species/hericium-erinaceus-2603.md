The Lion's Mane Mushroom functions as a parasite of living trees and a decomposer of deadwood and fruits in the summer and fall. It is widespread across North America and grows on deciduous wood (especially Oak).

The color of the mushroom is white becoming yellow with age. It forms as collection of spines all coming out of a single obscured ball growing out of the wood substrate, as opposed to [other _Hericium species_](/location/all/?q=Hericium) that grow in a branching pattern. They may be difficult to tell apart when the mushroom is young. It has a white spore print.
