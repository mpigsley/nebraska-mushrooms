The Spring Polypore (_Lentinus arcularius_) is a spring-time polypore that can be found growing on fallen wood. It appears to be a generalist in its wood choices as has been found growing on Hophornbeam, Eastern Red Cedar, Oak, and Birch. It can be growing gregariously, clustered, or singularly. Quite common in woodland settings in the spring.

The cap has a central depression and is tan colored with brownish scales. The scales toward the cap margin can become pointy.

The hymenophore is composed of angular pores in a radial pattern. It extends down the stem (decurrent). The pores are whitish or cream-colored. The spore print is white.

The stem is darker colored than the cap with noticeable scales.

This mushroom has a tough, elastic consistency.
