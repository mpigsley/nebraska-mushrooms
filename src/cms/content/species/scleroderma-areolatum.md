The Leopard Earthball (_Scleroderma areolatum_) is a mycorrhizal sequestrate fungi that can be found in the summer and fall. It features a brown mud-cracked pattern of scales that can be brushed off (areolate) across a yellowish ball shape. The contents are white when young, later turning purplish and blackish, and responding with an orange color when KOH is applied. The smell is sweet or similar to a #2 pencil eraser. The spores are spiked.

This genus is known to be poisonous.
