The Scaly Ink Cap (_Coprinopsis variegata_) is a decomposer that can be found in the spring and fall (occasionally in the summer). It is widely distributed and common in North America and can fruit in substantial numbers. It grows on wood and can appear like it is growing from the soil, though it is actually originating roots underground. It is widespread and common.

The mushroom originates from an egg-shaped button stage. As it grows, it splits the veil open leaving bits of split tissue on the cap surface and remnants of the veil on the stem near the base. The gill color starts whitish, becoming black at maturity.

This mushroom will digest itself through a phenomenon called `deliquescence` or "the process of turning into a liquid". The inky mess is loaded with spores. Flies and other insects are attracted to it and get covered in the ink, which later disperse the spores by traveling to other areas. This is an amazing example of how mushrooms hack the behaviors of other organisms to complete their lifecycles and spread to new territories.
