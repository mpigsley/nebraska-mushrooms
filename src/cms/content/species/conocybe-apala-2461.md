The Milky Conecap is a decomposer that is common in lawns during the summer and fall months but can also be found in dung, compost, and woodchips. Widespread.

Conocybe can be distinguished by a cone-shaped cap, brown spores, and shallow gills. Although this species isn't known to be poisonous, other species in the genus can be deadly, so it's best to consider this species poisonous as well.
