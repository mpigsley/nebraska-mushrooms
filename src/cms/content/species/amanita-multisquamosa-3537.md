This is a presumed toxic, mycorrhizal mushroom growing on soil in the spring through fall. It can be found associated with Oak and other broadleaf trees east of the Great Plains.

It is mostly white, with a yellow or tan cap center. The cap is adorned with white, removable warts.

The gill attachment is free to nearly attached (acutely adnexed), and the gill spacing is crowded.

This species usually provides a skirt of tissue on the stem (annulus), but the skirt has either been eaten by bugs or removed by other means in this specimen. Note how difficult it can be to identify Amanitas because of clues (like the annulus) getting lost through time!

It has a bulbous base with a collar-like cup (volva) and sometimes transient velar tissue extending further up the stem (pictured).

This mushroom has the provisional name Amanita "multisquamosa-01" until it can be formally described.
