_Calonarius caesiofulvus_ is a mycorrhizal mushroom that forms a symbiotic association with trees in the _Fagaceae_ (oaks, beech, etc.). This mushroom was recently described in 2024 (Liu, et al., 2024) and has so far been reported only from Gainesville, Florida, and Indian Cave State Park (ICSP) in Nebraska. It has been found fruiting at ICSP in late September, presumably associating with Oak trees. The Latin name refers to the changing colors of the fruiting bodies as they mature: *caesi-* meaning bluish-gray and *fulv-* meaning reddish-yellow or tawny (Borror, 1988).

__Cap:__ hemisphereical when young becoming broadly convex to nearly flat with age. The surface texture is innately fibrillose (covered with fine, adhering fibers), viscid (slimy or tacky), and pale grayish purple when young, turning brown with a yellow margin as it matures. The flesh (context) is white to yellow.

__Gills:__ crowded and yellow.

__Stem:__ dry, with a cortina (a cobweb-like partial veil) that leaves a brown annular zone from spore deposits. The base is marginate (featuring a bulb with an angular ridge marking the attachment of the universal veil) and often bears remnants of a bluish-purple universal veil. The flesh is yellow, especially towards the base.

__Basal mycelium:__ white to yellow.

__Odor and taste:__ not distinctive.
