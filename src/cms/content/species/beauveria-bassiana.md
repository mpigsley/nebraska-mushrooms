The Icing Sugar Fungus (_Beauveria bassiana_) is a widespread insect pathogen that can be found year-round infecting various species of hosts. The fungi erupt out of the joints of the insect exoskeleton as a white, powdery mass full of reproductive spores. This species infects a wide range of arthropod species. It has been used as a natural insecticide to combat a wide range of insects.

In many [_Ascomycetes_](/taxa/ascomycota), species can have multiple life stages. A stage where they make asexual spores via mitosis (anamorphic phase) and a life stage where they make sexual spores via meiosis (teleomorphic phase). _Beauveria_ species are an anamorph for matching _Cordyceps_ teleomorph. Past mycological convention was to separate these two forms into different species (like _Beauveria_ and _Cordyceps_), and modern convention is to group them into one species. In the future, we may see the genus _Beauveria_ disappear in favor of their respective teleomorphic _Cordyceps_ species.
