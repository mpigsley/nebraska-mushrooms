The Black-staining Polypore (_Meripilus sumstinei_) is a parasite and decomposer of broadleaf trees and fruits in the summer and fall. It is often mistaken for Chicken of the Woods [_Laetiporus_](/taxa/laetiporus), though it can be distinguished by its black-staining nature and has much smaller pores. It grows in large clusters of rosettes at the base of broadleaf trees.

The black-staining can commonly be observed on the rosette margins and wherever it is bruised. The white pore surface underneath features tiny pores. The flesh is white and stringy. The spore print is white.
