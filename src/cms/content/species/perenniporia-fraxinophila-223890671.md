The Ash Conk (_Perenniporia fraxinophila_) is parasitic on Ash trees (_Fraxinus sp._). These conks can be found year-round and appear slightly emerging from the wood. Many times it may go unnoticed as it blends in to the shape of the Ash bark.

The fertile surface is whitish and composed of small pores that are rounded or oblonged in shape; 2-3 pores per mm. The top if the cap is colored dark green to blackish.
