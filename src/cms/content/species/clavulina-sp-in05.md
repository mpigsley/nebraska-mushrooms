Observed in the summer at Indian Cave State Park in eastern Nebraska, this small, white, coral-like fungus was growing gregariously among moss on the forest floor. Its branching form was compact but distinct, with multiple fruiting bodies locally abundant. It appeared to be mycorrhizal, associating with nearby hardwoods. This collection was originally documented in southern Indiana and is currently being referred to under the provisional name *Clavulina* “sp-IN05” while it awaits formal study and description.
