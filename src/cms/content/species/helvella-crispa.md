The White Saddle is a presumed mycorrhizal mushroom that can be found on soil or well-rotted wood in the spring to summer months. It can be found growing alone or in groups under deciduous and conifer trees.

The cap is generally saddle-shaped, but does present more chaotic shapes as the mushroom grows and folds on itself. The stem is ribbed, tough, and occasionally with tiny holes. The saddle portion is a spore-producing surface. The spore print is white.
