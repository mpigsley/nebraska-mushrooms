_Sanghuangporus weirianus_ is a parasite and decomposer of Black Walnut (_Juglans nigra_) and can be found year-round. The top of the cap is black with fissures that look similar to the way bark splits on a tree. This conk is hard, perennial, and exclusively favors Walnut (_Juglans_). The top of the cap is black, and the bottom pore surface is cream to orange-brown with tiny pores with an iridescent shine. It has a pale-yellow spore print.

Also known as _Phellinus weirianus_.

Compare to [_Fulvifomes robiniae_](/species/fulvifomes-robiniae) which grows on Black Locust (_Robinia pseudoacacia_).

#### Ethnomycology

The genus _Sanghuangporus_ is named after the Chinese word 'sanghuang' which is what mushrooms in this genus go by in Chinese herbal markets. (Zhou, et al., 2016)
