The Deer-colored Trametes (_Trametopsis cervina_) is a decomposer of wood and can be found from spring through fall. It grows somewhat lumpy and crust-like until it develops cap shapes. The caps are irregular in outline (not smooth toward the cap margin) and does not have a stem (sessile). The cap is orangish, brownish, or "deer-colored" and features zones of slightly different color and texture. The pore surface is whitish and turns brown with age. The pores begin slot-like, becoming toothed with age.
