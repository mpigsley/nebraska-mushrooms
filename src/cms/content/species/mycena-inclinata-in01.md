_Mycena inclinata-IN01_ is a common decomposer of wood and fruits in the spring and fall. The featured specimens were found in an Oak/Hickory woodland at Indian Cave State Park in southeastern Nebraska. It grows on wood in clusters.

The cap is variable in color but mostly some shade between yellow, brown, tan, or white. The cap is egg-shaped when young becoming bell-shaped at maturity. When young, the cap margin features a serrated edge (or teeth). The gills are attached to the stem and develop cross-veins when mature. The stem is equal, fragile, and hollow. The spore print is white.
