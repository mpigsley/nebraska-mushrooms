The Woolly Oyster (*Hohenbuehelia mastrucata*) is a rare decomposer of dead wood that can be found in the summer through fall. It can be found growing on Maple (*Acer sp.*) and other broadleaf trees throughout eastern North America. Fruiting bodies are often on bottom of fallen wood, which can create beautiful circular gill patterns. This specimen was growing on fallen Bitternut Hickory (*Carya cordiformis*).

The cap shape is evenly rounded (convex) becoming flat (plane) with age. The cap color can be different shades of gray. The consistency is rubbery and moist to the touch (when fresh). The cap is ornamented with distinctive gelatinous spines. The gills are colored whitish to grayish. The spore print is white.
