#### Description

This is a hollow mushroom, 2-4 inches tall. It is bright yellow when young, turning a dull brown with time. It has a fuzzy cap and the odor of Clorox, which makes it easily identifiable from other mushrooms. It is a mycorrhizal mushroom.

#### Habitat

White morels occur in sites ranging from deep-shaded forest ravines to open Bur Oak hilltop prairies to floodplain Cottonwood forests. It commonly grows near recently dead Elms and Cottonwoods, feeding on the recently deceased roots, but is found near many other tree species.

#### Abundance

**Indian Cave State Park**: Common and abundant. Especially abundant along Trail 9 near the overlook. ([map](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=160642&subview=map&taxon_id=56830))

**Statewide Range**: Common throughout Nebraska in wooded habitats. ([map](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&project_id=104132&subview=map&taxon_id=56830))

**North America**: Widespread.

#### Fruiting Period

This spring-time mushroom appears in mid-April through May at Indian Cave. In
northern Nebraska, it can still be found in mid-June. It may not appear in dry years.

#### Similar Species in Nebraska

- The Half Free Morel (*Morchella punctipes*) fruits at similiar times or soon after the White Morel, but its cap is attached at the top only extends halfway down the stem like a skirt if the mushroom is sliced lengthwise.
- The giant morel is a later-fruiting and less common species that grows up to 8 inches tall and is a duller yellow color.
- There are undoubtedly more species of Morels in the state that are less common.

#### Interesting facts

- The Yellow Morel (*Morchella esculena*) is a purely European species. The common name for the most common North American morels are called White Morels.
- Many Nebraskan's distinguish smaller, gray-colored morels as a separate species with the common name "Gray Morel". However, these individuals are actually less mature White Morels (Kuo 2012).
- This common morel is among our most delicious edible mushrooms and is pursued by many Nebraskans. It can be cooked in numerous ways. People have gotten sick from eating this species undercooked.
- Native Americans used this species as a medical mushroom to treat whooping cough. Today, a compound from the mushroom is used to treat foot odor.
- A morel species in northeastern North America (M. cryptica) can't be distinguished from the White Morel without DNA testing.

#### [Edibility](/articles/concerning-wild-mushroom-edibility/) and Toxicity

Choice edible, poisonous if eaten raw or undercooked.

Morels **must be thoroughly cooked to be safely eaten**! Poisonings from raw or undercooked morels are serious and have led to death.
