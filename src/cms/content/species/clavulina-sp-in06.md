Observed in the summer at Indian Cave State Park in eastern Nebraska, this small, white fungus had a coral/club-like form with minimal branching compared to other *Clavulina* species in the area. It was growing on the ground in a mixed hardwood forest, appearing to be mycorrhizal. The shape and stature were reminiscent of *Clavulina rugosa*. This collection is currently being referred to under the provisional name *Clavulina* “sp-IN06” while it awaits formal study and description.
