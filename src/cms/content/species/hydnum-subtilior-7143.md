The Slender Hedgehog is a mycorrhizal mushroom that can be found in the summer through fall in woods. It seems to be a generalist and can associate with many species of deciduous and conifers trees. Distributed east of the Rocky Mountains.

Under the cap are spines or teeth that set it apart from the gilled mushrooms (agarics). The odor is sweet and taste is pleasant. The spore print is white.
