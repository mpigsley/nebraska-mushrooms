The Crowded Parchment is a common, widespread decomposer of dead deciduous wood (especially Oak) in wooded areas. Although persisting year-round, new growth can be most easily observed in the spring and summer after times of extended rainfall. Growing generally out of the cracks of bark, it can be distinguished by its orange color and chaotic shelving pattern. It has a white spore print.
