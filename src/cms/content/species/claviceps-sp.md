_Claviceps_ species grow on grass seeds in the summer and fall. It can be found after times of heavy rain during grass seed development. The visible black part is a `sclerotium` which is fungal growth that serves as energy reserves for the fungus. Like a "fungal potato".

_Claviceps_ is highly poisonous. The resulting poisoning syndrome is known as `ergotism` and has also been named "St. Anthony's Fire" and "Devil's Curse".

> "Convulsions, muscle spasms, vomiting, hallucinations, and a gangrenous pain where the victim’s limbs, fingers, toes, and nose were “eaten up by the holy fire that blackened like charcoal” characterize ergot poisoning. Victims often lost parts of their extremities or entire limbs due to blood vessel constriction associated with gangrenous ergotism." ([U.S. Forest Service](https://www.fs.usda.gov/wildflowers/ethnobotany/Mind_and_Spirit/ergot.shtml))

If you or someone you know has been poisoned by consuming wild fungi, call 9-1-1 and get the individual medical attention IMMEDIATELY. Afterwards, please [report poisonings](https://namyco.org/interests/toxicology/report-a-poisoning/) to the North American Mycological Association to contribute to our understanding of wild mushroom safety.
