The Orange Pinwheel (_Marasmius siccus_) is a small decomposer that can be found in duff and leaf litter from summer through fall east of the Rocky Mountains.

The cap is pleated and shaped like a pinwheel. The gills are white and distant. The stems of _Marasmius_ mushrooms are elastic. This one has a dark to black stem and white basal mycelium at the point of attachment to the substrate.
