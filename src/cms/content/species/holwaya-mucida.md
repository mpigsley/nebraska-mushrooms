The Tapioca Club (_Holwaya mucida_) is a decomposer of wood. At Indian Cave State Park, it has found in the fall great numbers (hundreds to thousands) in the bark fissures of American Linden (_Tilia americana_). It features a black club form with a white, jelly-like apex which is easily rubbed off when fresh with a texture like tapioca pudding. The apex later turns gray colored with age. The species is polymorphic and can also be found in a black cup form amidst the clubs (not pictured).
