*Coltricia* species can be found in forested soil along woodland trails during the summer. The species collected for this study is an undescribed North American species going under the cryptic name *Coltricia sp-IN01*. It has a circular shape in outline (from the top down) and is navel-shaped, sunken in the center, or somewhat funnel shaped. The flesh is quite thin and flexible. The tooth-shaped reproductive surface on the bottom of the cap provide a unique distinguishing feature along with its central stem and terrestrial habit.

Stay tuned for more details once it gets described.
