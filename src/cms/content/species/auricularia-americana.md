The American Tree Ear is a decomposer of dead broadleaf wood and can be found in the spring through fall. It is a common mushroom that is widely distributed in North America (and possibly further).

The fruiting body takes the form a jelly-like structure. The shape is "ear"-shaped, fan-shaped, cup-shaped, and variations in-between. The color is brownish to reddish-brown becoming darker colors as it dries out. The spore print is white.

A good time to search for this mushroom are after a period of consistent, heavy rains.
