_Helvella macropus_ appears in summer and fall in deciduous woodlands. It grows on the ground or from forest litter such as bark, duff, and rotted wood. Reported in shaded slopes beneath Bitternut Hickory (_Carya cordiformis_). The species name _macropus_ means “long foot,” referring to its proportionally long stipe. Fruiting bodies may occur singly or gregariously.

The "cap" is shaped like a shallow cup, smooth and grayish on the inside, with a slightly fuzzy outer surface that’s about the same color. It sits on a long, narrow, white stem that’s smooth to the touch. The entire mushroom has a delicate, upright form. It doesn’t have any noticeable smell. The spore print is white.
