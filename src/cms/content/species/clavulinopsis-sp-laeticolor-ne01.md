_Clavulinopsis laeticolor-NE01_ was found in Indian Cave State Park in late September on mossy soil in an Oak/Hickory woodland. It occurred in scattered but locally abundant clusters along a shaded trail.

Fruiting bodies are slender, unbranched, and vivid yellow to orange, usually under 2 inches (5 cm) tall, and smooth to the touch. They grow scattered or in small groups on soil or moss in woods, often among grasses or mosses, and may fade with age. The base is usually whitish, and the flesh is soft and pale. The spore print is white.
