*Hygrophorus* sp-NY03 was found in late fall growing among mosses at the edge of a mixed Oak woodland at Indian Cave State Park in eastern Nebraska. It was originally collected from New York. Nearby trees and shrubs included Northern Red Oak (*Quercus rubra*), Eastern Red Cedar (*Juniperus virginiana*), Black Oak (*Quercus velutina*), Roughleaf Dogwood (*Cornus drummondii*), and distant Chinkapin Oak (*Quercus muehlenbergii*).

Fruiting bodies were observed in mossy soil, but no detailed cap or gill coloration was recorded. The spore print is white.
