_Amanita sp-NE01_ is a mycorrhizal mushroom that can be found in the summer in woodland settings. This one was found growing from a moss pad in an Oak/Hickory forest at Indian Cave State Park in eastern Nebraska.

The cap is colored light tan. The pattern on the cap are lines (striations) that go from the cap margin to 1/2 to the center of the cap. The gills are free from the stem to narrowly attached to it (acutely adnexed). The stem does not have a ring (annulus) and it has a cup at the base (volva). The volva looks like a sheath or a loose membranous sock on the base of the stem.
