_Cortinarius tiffanyae_ is a mycorrhizal mushroom that appears in mid to late summer (July–August) in hardwood forests of northeastern North America. It grows on the ground in association with trees like oak (_Quercus_), beech (_Fagus_), maple (_Acer_), basswood (_Tilia_), and elm (_Ulmus_) (Healy et al., 2020). This species was named in honor of Dr. Lois H. Tiffany, a pioneering mycologist from Iowa State University.

The cap starts out conical or rounded and flattens with age, often developing a small bump in the center. Its surface is dry, silky, and shiny when fresh, usually showing fine radial cracks as it matures. Colors range from dark reddish-brown to paler reddish-yellow as the cap dries. The gills are widely spaced and shift from pale purplish to reddish-brown, often with lighter edges. The stem can show a gradient of color—lavender near the top fading to cream, and ending in a yellow-orange to reddish base. A reddish-brown spore print and an unpleasant or fruity odor help set this species apart from others in the woods.
