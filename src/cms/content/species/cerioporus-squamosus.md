#### Description

Key features include:

- Flattened scales (squamules) on the cap surface. A feature from which the mushroom gets its name _C. squamosus_.
- Large, honeycomb-like pores under the cap that extend down the stem. The pore surface is not separatable from the cap.
- The distinctive smell of watermelon rind.
- White spore print.

This is a large and common mushroom in Nebraska. It's most noticable by its scales on the cap surface and the smell of watermelon rind. The cap color is pale tan to creamy yellowish with brown to black scales. When old, the cap color turns whitish with reddish to blackish scales sometimes with a dark brown to black patch in the center of the cap and black velvet extending from the base of the stem upwards. The cap shape is variable, but mostly semicircular to kidney-shaped to fan-shaped. The stem is generally tough and cork-like, especially with age. This species can get particularly large, generally a cap of 5-30 cm wide and 1-4 cm thick and stem 1-4 cm thick and 2-8 cm long.

#### Habitat

Dryad's Saddle can be found fruiting from decaying logs, stumps, and living trees on a wide variety of broadleaf trees (especially Silver Maple and Boxelder) in woodland settings, urban locations, and roadsides. It's known to be both saprobic and parasitic.

#### Abundance

Dryad's Saddle is the most commonly sighted mushroom in Nebraska, according to [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/nebraska-fungal-diversity). It is generally found growing alone or in small groups.

#### Fruiting Period

This mushroom can be found fruiting from spring through fall. However, it prefers cooler weather and is most abundant in the spring and fall. This is a common mushroom to find while morel hunting. Although the mushroom is not perineal, its older forms can be found in the winter, slowly decomposing, making it discoverable year-round.

#### Similar Species

- [Cerioporus varius](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/178674415) is a close relative that is smaller in size.

#### Edibility

This is a good edible mushroom when collected young in its small button stage. It's easy to determine edible parts, as they will be soft, pliable, and break apart by hand. With age, the mushroom becomes leathery and undesirable. Older specimens can be collected for the table by cutting the softer edges on the cap margin with a knife. All wild mushrooms should be cooked thoroughly before eating. Please see our [disclaimer](/articles/concerning-wild-mushroom-edibility/) before eating any wild mushrooms.

#### Toxicity

This mushroom is not known to be toxic. However, allergies and sensitivities may affect individuals differently. Please use caution when eating any wild mushrooms.
