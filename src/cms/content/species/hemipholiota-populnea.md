The Destructive Pholiota (_Hemipholiota populnea_) is a decomposer of Cottonwood trees (_Populus sp._) and can be found from late summer through winter. It has a tough consistency, stout stature, and is ornamented with noticeable scales and veil tissue on the cap surface and hanging from the margin (appendiculate). It commonly grows from natural splits in the wood and prefers to grow from trunks and larger branches. The fruiting bodies can be found growing alone, clustered, or in groups.

The gills are attached to the stem and commonly possess a decurrent tooth near the point of attachment. When young, the gills are protected by a veil that later breaks and leaving ring on the stem and the appendiculate margin. The gills are colored cinnamon-brown. The spore print is also cinnamon-brown.
