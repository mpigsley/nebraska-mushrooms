#### Description

This is a hollow mushroom, 2-4 inches tall. It is bright yellow when young, turning a dull brown with time. It has a fuzzy cap and the odor of Clorox, which makes it easily identifiable from other mushrooms. It is a mycorrhizal mushroom.

#### Habitat

Yellow morels occur in sites ranging from deep-shaded forest ravines to open Bur Oak hilltop prairies to floodplain Cottonwood forests. It commonly grows near recently dead Elms and Cottonwoods, feeding on the recently deceased roots, but is found near many other tree species.

#### Abundance

**Indian Cave State Park**: Common and abundant. Especially abundant along Trail 9 near the overlook. ([map](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=160642&subview=map&taxon_id=56830))

**Statewide Range**: Common throughout Nebraska in wooded habitats. ([map](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&project_id=104132&subview=map&taxon_id=56830))

**North America**: Widespread.

#### Fruiting Period

This spring-time mushroom appears in mid-April through May at Indian Cave. In
northern Nebraska, it can still be found in mid-June. It may not appear in dry years.

#### Similar Species in Nebraska

* The giant morel is a later-fruiting and less common species that grows up to 8 inches tall and is a duller yellow color. 
* There are undoubtedly more species of Morels in the state that are less common.

#### Interesting facts

* The common morel is among our most delicious edible mushrooms and is pursued by many Nebraskans. It can be cooked in numerous ways. People have gotten sick from eating this species undercooked. Native Americans used this species as a medical mushroom to treat whooping cough. Today, a compound from the mushroom is used to treat foot odor.
* Recent DNA studies (Kuo 2012) suggest that mushrooms commonly called "gray morels" probably aren't distinct from this species in North America. The "gray morels" in the study's samples turned out to be younger "yellow morels" according to their genetic code.
* A morel species in northeastern North America (M. cryptica) can't be distinguished from the "yellow morel" without DNA testing.

#### [Edibility](https://nebraskamushrooms.org/articles/concerning-wild-mushroom-edibility/)

Choice edible, poisonous if eaten raw.

#### Toxicity

Morels **must be thoroughly cooked to be safely eaten**! Poisonings from raw or undercooked morels are serious and have led to death.
