#### Description

This is a hollow-stemmed mushroom, 2-4 inches tall. It is bright yellow when young, turning a dull brown with time. It has a fuzzy cap and the odor of Clorox which makes it easily identifiable from other mushrooms. It is a mycorrhizal mushroom.

#### Habitat

Yellow morels occur in sites ranging from deep-shaded forest ravines to open Bur Oak hilltop prairies to floodplain Cottonwood forests. It commonly grows near recently dead Elms and Cottonwoods feeding on the recently deceased roots, but is found near many other tree species.

#### Abundance

##### Indian Cave State Park

This is a widespread and common mushroom in the Park. It is especially abundant along Trail 9 near the overlook. ([map](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=160642&subview=map&taxon_id=56830))

##### Statewide Range

This mushroom is common throughout Nebraska in wooded habitats. ([map](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&project_id=104132&subview=map&taxon_id=56830))

#### Fruiting Period

This spring-time mushroom appears in mid-April through May at Indian Cave. In
northern Nebraska it can still be found through mid-June. It may not appear in dry years.

#### Similar Species

There are 4 other morel species in Nebraska. The giant morel is a later-fruiting and less common species that grows up to 8 inches tall and is a more dull yellow color. The little grey morel appears earlier than the common morel and is 1 to 2 inches tall and grey in color. The common yellow morel can only be distinguished from the less common yellow morel through DNA analysis.

#### Interesting facts

The common morel is one of our most delicious edible mushrooms and is pursued by
many Nebraskans. It can be cooked in numerous ways. People have gotten sick from eating this species
under cooked. Native American used this species as a medical mushroom to treat hooping cough.
Today, a compound from the mushroom is used to treat foot odor.

General Comments: This Enteloma mushroom could only be identified to the genus level even through
DNA analysis. Further study is needed. This is a field where we could put some technical information.

Edibility: Choice. (Read this first! Link to article)

Toxicity: Morels **must be thoroughly cooked to be safely eaten**! Poisonings from raw or undercooked morels are serious and have led to death.
