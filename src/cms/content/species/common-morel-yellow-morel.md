#### Description

This is a hollow mushroom, 2-4 inches tall. It is bright yellow when young, turning a dull brown with time. It has a fuzzy cap and the odor of Clorox, which makes it easily identifiable from other mushrooms. It is a mycorrhizal mushroom.

#### Habitat

Yellow morels occur in sites ranging from deep-shaded forest ravines to open Bur Oak hilltop prairies to floodplain Cottonwood forests. It commonly grows near recently dead Elms and Cottonwoods, feeding on the recently deceased roots, but is found near many other tree species.

#### Abundance

##### Indian Cave State Park

This is a widespread and common mushroom in the Park. It is especially abundant along Trail 9 near the overlook. ([map](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=160642&subview=map&taxon_id=56830))

##### Statewide Range

This mushroom is common throughout Nebraska in wooded habitats. ([map](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&project_id=104132&subview=map&taxon_id=56830))

#### Fruiting Period

This spring-time mushroom appears in mid-April through May at Indian Cave. In
northern Nebraska, it can still be found in mid-June. It may not appear in dry years.

#### Similar Species

There are 4 other morel species in Nebraska. 

* The giant morel is a later-fruiting and less common species that grows up to 8 inches tall and is a duller yellow color. 
* The little grey morel appears earlier than the common morel and is 1 to 2 inches tall and grey in color. The common yellow morel can only be distinguished from the less common yellow morel through DNA analysis.

#### Interesting facts

The common morel is one of our most delicious edible mushrooms and is pursued by
many Nebraskans. It can be cooked in numerous ways. People have gotten sick from eating this species undercooked. Native Americans used this species as a medical mushroom to treat whooping cough. Today, a compound from the mushroom is used to treat foot odor.
