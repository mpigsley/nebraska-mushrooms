The Wrinkled Fieldcap (_Agrocybe rivulosa_) is a brown-spored, gilled decomposer that grows in soil in woodland settings.

It has a wrinkled cap top surface that is mostly white becoming tan towards the center. The stem is relatively long, has a ring (annulus), and has an abrupt bulb at the base with white "roots" (pseudorhizomorphs). The gills are slightly attached to the stem and begin light-colored and turn more brown with maturity.
