*Fomitopsis meliae* appears from spring through fall on fallen hardwood, especially Ash (*Fraxinus* spp.), where it grows scattered along barkless portions of downed trunks. These observations were made near the edge of an open Oak–Hickory woodland. The species name *meliae* refers to ash trees, drawing from an old Latin name for the genus *Fraxinus*.

Caps are firm and damp, dingy white, and bruise dark gray when scratched. The pore surface is similarly colored, with tiny round pores that bruise gray and may elongate as the fruit body thickens. The flesh has a tough, leathery consistency when fresh, drying to a tough, corky texture. Odor is fragrant or fruity, and the taste is slightly bitter.
