The Green Cracking Russula (_Russula sp-IN162_) is a distinctive mycorrhizal mushroom that can be found in woodland settings in the summer. This one was found at Indian Cave State Park in eastern Nebraska growing from the soil near Ash, Chinkapin Oak, American Hophornbeam, Bur Oak, and Shagbark Hickory trees. There are other closely related species that share this morphology in _Russula subsect. Virescentinae_.

The cap is uniquely "green-cracked" and the cap leather will easily pull from the margin of the cap to 2/3 the distance to the center. The gills are close, cream to pink colored when fresh, and display a forking pattern close to the stem. The fruiting body is quite sturdy for a _Russula_.
