Kerrigan's Champion (_Agaricus kerriganii_) is a brown-spored gilled mushroom that grows in soil in wooded habitats. It can be found from late summer to early fall in Oak and Pine forests. It has a skirt on the stem without a cup at the stem base. It bruises yellow.

#### Morphology

- Cap shape evenly rounded to half-sphere, later becoming flat to centrally depressed with age. 1.5-2.5 inches (4-6 cm) wide.
- Texture smooth and dry. Ornamentation can be silky to scaly. Grayish brown becoming more brown towards the center of the cap.
- The gills are free from the stem. The gill color is light pink when young, becoming darker pink, then becoming brown with age. This is due to brown spores maturing on the gill surface over time.
- Stem with a membranous skirt on the top half and a bulb on the base. Sometimes curved. 1.2-2 inches (3-5 cm) long.
- Bruising yellow where handled. Bruising red with age and decomposition.
- Spore print brown.
