_Donkia pulcherrima_ appears in summer and early fall on decaying logs of broadleaf trees, often in shaded, moist forests. It grows in small clusters or alone. The species name means "most beautiful," a reference to its striking appearance. The genus *Donkia* was named in honor of mycologist Marinus Anton Donk.

Fruiting bodies are semicircular to fan-shaped, with caps that are dull yellow to orangish yellow, often fading to whitish or tan with age. The cap surface features a woolly texture. The underside bears densely packed spines. Flesh is tough and corky, becoming spongy when wet. There is typically no stem, or only a short lateral stub. The spore print is white.
