_Deconica coprophila_ is a decomposer of dung that can be found in the summer. Mostly found on horse or livestock dung in Nebraska, it is a small mushroom that generally grows in large groups. It has what is known as a `gelatinous pellicule`, which means the top layer of the cap is jelly-like and stretchy. So much that can stretch beyond the point that the rest of the cap will break. It's almost like a "second skin" covering over the top of the cap. This feature is known to the genera _Deconica_ and _Psilocybe_.

This mushroom was once included in the genus _Psilocybe_ and was moved to its own genus due to the absence of the mind-altering substance Psilocybin and genetic differences. 

The cap is brown and shiny when wet (due to the gelatinous pellicule) drying to a tanish color. Velar tissue can commonly be found on the cap margin. The stem is 'scurfy' featuring small groups (or tufts) of fibrils (hairs). The gills are horizontally attached to the stem (adnate). The spore print is blackish.
