The Latte Bracket is a decomposer of deciduous wood and pines that can be observed year-round, but only grows in times of heavy, warm rain. It is widespread in eastern North America.

The top surface of the fruiting body is slightly hairy (tomentose), and white to cream to brown in a zoned pattern. The top-view shape of the cap is half-circular to kidney-shaped, and the side-view shape is evenly rounded to flat. The consistently is tough and corky. The pores on the underside are round to oblong to angular, but never maze-like. _Trametes lactinea_ was considered a tropical mushroom, but has more recently been found across eastern North America suggesting that it may have extended its range over the last few decades.
