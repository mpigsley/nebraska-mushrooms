Gymnopus barbipes is a gilled mushroom that can be found in the summer and fall decomposing deciduous duff and leaf litter.

The stem is distinctively flattnened, hollow, and the basal mycelium binds to its substrate with white rhizomorphs. This mushroom gets its name from the felty white mycelium at the base of the stem (not shown).

The gills are white and shallow. They are attached to the stem or pulling away from it from drying.

The entire fruiting body is elastic and tough, which is distinctive of other [Gymnopus](/location/indian-cave-state-park/?q=gymnopus) as well.
