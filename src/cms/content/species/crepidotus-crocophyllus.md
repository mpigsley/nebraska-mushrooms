The Saffron Oysterling (_Crepidotus crocophyllus_) is a wood-decaying fungus (saprotroph) that grows on dead wood. It fruits from spring through fall and is widely distributed across tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions. The fruiting bodies usually grow in clusters or scattered along fallen logs, often resembling small seashells.

The scientific name _crocophyllus_ comes from the Greek _krokos_ (‘saffron, orange-colored’) Latinized to _croc_-, combined with -_phyllon_ (‘leaf’); literally meaning “saffron leaf.” In mycology, the suffix -_phyllus_ refers to gills, highlighting the saffron-yellow gills of young specimens (Donald J. Borror, 1988).

When young, this mushroom is strikingly bright in color. The cap surface is woolly, covered with brown or wine-colored fibrils (tiny hair-like fibers), and the margin (edge of the cap) is rolled inward. The gills start out saffron-yellow with somewhat jagged edges. As the mushroom matures, the cap surface becomes smoother and dull brown, though it often retains a bit of woolly texture near the center. The cap margin straightens with age, and the gills fade to white, tan, or brownish tones.

This species lacks a true stem, produces a brown spore print, and is considered hygrophanous (it changes color based on its hydration level). It has no distinct odor, but the taste is reported as bitter.

A simple chemical test with potassium hydroxide (KOH) can help with identification. On young caps, KOH turns the surface red, while on older caps it produces gray to black reactions. Applied to the gills, KOH creates a vivid red color.

This species is not considered edible.
