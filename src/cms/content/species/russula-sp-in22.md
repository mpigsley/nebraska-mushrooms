The Purple-Bloom Russula (_Russula sp-IN22_) is a colorful mycorrhizal mushroom that can be found in woodland settings in the summer. This one was found in an Oak/Hickory woodland at Indian Cave State Park in eastern Nebraska growing from soil near Chinkapin Oak, Shagbark Hickory, Northern Red Oak, Bur Oak, Black Oak, distant Elm and Black Walnut trees.

The smell and taste are pleasant, reminding the mycologist of floral notes. It's distinctly purple with reddish hints and the gills are yellow. The large cap creates a bowl in the center (narrowly depressed) with age. It's not uncommon to find little pools of rainwater in these little "mushroom bowls".
