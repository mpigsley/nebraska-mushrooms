*Coprinopsis pseudonivea* is a small mushroom that grows on cow dung or compost, most often during the summer through fall. It appears alone or in small groups and belongs to the group of the inkcaps, which dissolve into black ink as they mature. The name *pseudonivea* means “false snow-white,” referring to its resemblance to *Coprinopsis nivea*, a similar species. It is known for its variable and often strong smell, described by different collectors as yeast-like, coconut, cinnamon, or fruity.

The cap starts out narrow and oval, then expands to about 1.5 inches (4 cm) wide. It is coated in a white to gray powdery layer and often splits around the edges as it opens. The gills are not attached to the stem and change from white to black with age. The stem is long and slender, white to grayish in color, sometimes slightly swollen at the base, and covered with soft white flakes. The spore print is dark purple-black.
