*Hohenbuehelia grisea*, known as the Shadowy Oysterling, appears in fall in woodland settings. It usually grows directly on decaying hardwood debris, though also has been found on debris including Black Walnut (*Juglans nigra*) shells. The species name *grisea* refers to its typical gray coloration.

The cap is thin, gray, and bald, with an inrolled margin when fresh. The tissues are semi-translucent and delicate. Gills are pale gray to cream, wavy, and interspersed with many short gills. It is sessile (directly attached the substrate without a stem) or features a short pseudosteme. The spore print is white.
