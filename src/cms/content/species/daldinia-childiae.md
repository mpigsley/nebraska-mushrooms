_Daldinia childiae_ is a decomposer of wood and is common in Nebraska. The fruiting times are spring through fall, though the tough fruiting bodies will overwinter and can be found year-round. Though mostly found on broadleaf trees it is sometimes found on conifers.

The fruiting body is mostly ball-shaped with an outer surface that is black or brown. When broke in half, the contents feature charcoal-like concentric zones of black and gray. When these contents are mixed with dilute KOH the resulting color is brownish which distinguishes it from the European _Daldinia concentrica_ which produces purple with the same test.
