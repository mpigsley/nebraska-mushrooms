The Green-spored Parasol (_Chlorophyllum molybdites_) is a widespread mushroom that can be found in lawns and fields from summer through fall. It sometimes fruits in fairy rings. This is a poisonous mushroom that is commonly misidentified as an edible species of _Macrolepiota_. 

The Green-spored Parasol is the [main source of poisoning in Nebraska](https://www.nebmyco.com/blog/2024-08-22-psa-poisonous-green-spored-parasol-in-nebraska-lawns/). Although generally not deadly, it can cause severe gastrointestinal upset along with an uncomfortable hospital visit.

The main separating features of this species are free gills and an olive-green spore print. The gills will be greenish at maturity.

If you or someone you know has been poisoned by consuming wild mushrooms, call 9-1-1 and get the individual medical attention IMMEDIATELY. Afterwards, please [report poisonings](https://namyco.org/interests/toxicology/report-a-poisoning/) to the North American Mycological Association to contribute to our understanding of wild mushroom safety.
