The Red Raspberry Slime Mold (_Tubifera ferruginosa_) is a slime mold that can be found growing on well-decomposed wood often covered with bryophytes (small moss-like plants). On closer inspection, the individual "clubs" are shaped like an egg or water droplets and can be found growing alone or in larger groups. It starts a pinkish orange color and later fades to gold then to black with age.

_Tubifera ferruginosa_ is not a true fungus, but rather a slime mold. Slime molds are different from fungi in how they live their lives. Most mushroom producing fungi are composed of tiny threads, whereas slime molds start their lives as individual single-celled organisms that join together to make larger reproductive groups.
