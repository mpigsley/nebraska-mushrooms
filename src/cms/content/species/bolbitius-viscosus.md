The Viscid Bolbitius (_Bolbitius viscosus_) is a small mushroom that grows on dead broadleaf trees. It can be found in spring through fall. Its cap width is generally no larger than 3/4 inch (2 cm). Cap surface colors range from gray-olive, to red, orange, and brown.

The cap surface can be slimy to tacky, so much so that it can literally stick to your hands. Its gills are attached to or pulling away from the stem. It has a cinnamon-brown spore print.
