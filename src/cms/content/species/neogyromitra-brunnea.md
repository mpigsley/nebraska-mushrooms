_Neogyromitra brunnea_ is a saprobic and mycorrhizal mushroom that can be found in spring-time forest settings under hardwoods. It can be found growing from the soil and well-decomposed stumps.

A field test for this mushroom is to slice it in half. If the inside is brain-like, the features lean more towards a False Morel like _Neogyromitra_ rather than the [True Morels (_Morcella_)](/taxa/morchella) which are hollow on the inside.

This mushroom should not be eaten. It contains a toxin call Gyromitrin that breaks down into what NASA uses as rocket fuel: monomethylhydrazine (MMH). It's highly toxic, carcinogenic, and easily evaporates into toxic fumes when cooking. Though some people still eat this mushroom as a delicacy, proper cooking requires a fume hood, many cycles of boiling and discarding water, and cultural experience to keep things safe.

Below are the effects of "Gyromitrin syndrome" defined by the North American Mycological Association:

> "Symptoms appear within 2 to 24 hours and include headaches, abdominal distress, severe diarrhea, and vomiting. In severe cases, liver, kidney, and red blood cell damage may occur, possibly resulting in death. Treatment is largely supportive, and a physician should be consulted." [(Beug, 2024)](https://namyco.org/interests/toxicology/mushroom-poisoning-syndromes/#gyro)

If you or someone you know has been poisoned by consuming wild mushrooms, call 9-1-1 and get the individual medical attention IMMEDIATELY. Afterwards, please [report poisonings](https://namyco.org/interests/toxicology/report-a-poisoning/) to the North American Mycological Association to contribute to our understanding of wild mushroom safety.
