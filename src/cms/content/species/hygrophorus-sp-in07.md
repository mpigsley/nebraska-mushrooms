_Hygrophorus sp-IN07_ was found growing from soil in low mixed Oak–Hickory woodland near a creek in Indian Cave State Park in eastern Nebraska. It was originally collected from southern Indiana. Nearby trees included American Hophornbeam (*Ostrya virginiana*), American Hackberry (*Celtis occidentalis*), Red Mulberry (*Morus rubra*), Northern Red Oak (*Quercus rubra*), American Linden (*Tilia americana*), and Shagbark Hickory (*Carya ovata*).

Fruiting bodies have whitish caps with a light tan center and a sticky surface when wet. Gills are light tan and waxy. The stem is white, slightly discoloring tan with handling or age. The spore print is white.
