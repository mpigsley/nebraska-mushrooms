The Stalked Elf Cup is a decomposer of deciduous twigs and duff (sometimes submerged in soil) and can be found in the spring through summer. It can be found east of the Rocky Mountains in North America through Mexico.

The *Sarcoscypha occidentalis group* can be distinguished from other *Sarcoscypha* by the presence of a stem. North America may see the group split into several distinct species in the coming decades, as DNA testing suggests that *Sarcoscypha occidentalis-IN03* could be a different species than others in the group. The fruiting body is saucer-shaped, scarlet colored on top and whitish on the bottom (the scarlet color shows through creating a muted scarlet effect). The stem is white, with cottony basal mycelial threads commonly present.
