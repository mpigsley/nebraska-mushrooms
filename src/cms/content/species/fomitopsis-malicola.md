_Fomitopsis malicola_ appears in spring and fall on dead wood of broadleaf trees; these collections were from shaded Oak–Hickory forests. It grows in shelves to gregarious clusters, reported on fallen branches including Chinqupin Oak (_Quercus muehlenbergii_) and Shagbark Hickory (_Carya ovata_).

Fruiting bodies are sessile and shelf-like to partially crust-like, with caps ranging from dull red-brown to yellow-tan or dull orange. Cap surfaces are smooth to bumpy and may show concentric zonation, with a hairy or uneven zone near the point of attachment. Pores on the underside are round to irregular, sometimes honeycomb-like, and range from white to cream or pale yellow. The fertile surface is hydrophobic. KOH applied to the cap produces a wine red reaction that later turns black; on the hymenium it produces a gray color. Ammonia applied to the cap first turns it orange-red, then dull dark red with a lighter margin; on the hymenium it produces a gray reaction. The spore print is white to pale yellow.
