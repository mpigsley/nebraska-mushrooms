*Ganoderma lobatum* is a sessile polypore found on buried roots, stumps, or compacted soil, often near woodland edges or along trails, appearing from late spring through fall. Fruiting bodies may collect debris as they develop, becoming partially embedded with soil and leaf litter.

The cap displays concentric zones of black, dark brown, and lighter brown, with a white growing edge. The surface is typically dull or slightly velvety. The pore surface is white and lumpy, bruising gray where damaged. The strong, sweet odor and bitter taste are notable. Chemical reactions include yellow staining on the hymenium with both KOH and ammonia.
