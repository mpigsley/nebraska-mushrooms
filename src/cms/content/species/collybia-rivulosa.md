The Fool's Funnel (*Collybia 'rivulosa PNW07'*, also known as *Clitocybe rivulosa*) is a decomposer that can be found in the late summer through fall and seems to have a global distribution. Its habit is to grow in arcs and rings in grasslands. It is relatively common and is a toxic look-alike of the Fairy Ring Mushroom (*Marasmius oreades*). The latter being an edible mushroom inhabiting the same habitat and growth habit (Wood, 2015).

This mushroom contains a toxin called **muscarine**. Please review the list of symptoms below.

> The symptoms usually occur within 15-30 minutes of ingestion, and are focused on the involuntary nervous system. They include excessive salivation, sweating, tears, lactation (in pregnant women), plus severe vomiting and diarrhea. These symptoms may be accompanied by visual disturbances, irregular pulse, decreased blood pressure, and difficulty breathing. Victims normally recover within 24 hours, but severe cases may result in death due to respiratory failure. Atropine is a specific antidote, but must be administered by a physician. Dogs are particularly susceptible to the toxin muscarine. [(Beug, 2024)](https://namyco.org/interests/toxicology/mushroom-poisoning-syndromes/#muscarine)

If you or someone you know has been poisoned by consuming wild mushrooms, call 9-1-1 and get the individual medical attention IMMEDIATELY. Afterwards, please [report poisonings](https://namyco.org/interests/toxicology/report-a-poisoning/) to the North American Mycological Association to contribute to our understanding of wild mushroom safety.
