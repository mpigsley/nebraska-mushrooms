_Rhodocollybia laulaha_ is a decomposer of wood and can be found in the summer through fall. The gills are extremely shallow (narrow), maze-like, and crowded. The spore print is white.

This mushroom was first described in Hawaii, and it was believed at the time that it was isolated to the Hawaiian islands. Recent DNA results have also placed this mushroom in Nebraska, Missouri, and Indiana. More research is needed to understand why, which makes this mushroom a subject of active research. 

The name _laulaha_ is the Hawaiian word for ‘common and widespread’. The name was meant to describe that it was endemic to the islands, though it is showing to have a disjunct range that includes the Midwest.
