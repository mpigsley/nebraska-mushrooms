The Trooping Crumble Cap (_Coprinellus disseminatus_) is a distinctive Ink Cap mushroom that can be found in soil or on decomposing wood. It is widespread and can be found in spring, summer, and fall. This mushroom is small, is quite fragile, does not transform into black ink (unlike most other Ink Caps), and is usually found in large groups (trooping).

The cap is pleated/grooved from the margin almost to the center. The gills start white when young, becoming gray-brown, then becoming black with maturity. The spore print is black. Attachments range from free, attached, or pulling away from the stem.
