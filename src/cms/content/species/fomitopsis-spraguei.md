The Green Cheese Polypore (_Fomitopsis spraguei_) is a decomposer and parasite of wood and can be found from spring through fall. It is commonly found on the base of broadleaf tree trunks growing in groups or alone. It bruises green when handled. Furthermore, it commonly exudes droplets of "mycosweat" or `guttation` which is a liquid secreted by the fungus that include digestive enzymes and antimicrobial compounds.
