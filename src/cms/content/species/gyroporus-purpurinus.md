*Gyroporus purpurinus* is a mycorrhizal bolete that appears in summer and fall in woodland settings, often growing singularly, scattered, or gregariously amidst broadleaf trees. It occurs on ridges and in shaded draws in oak–hickory forests, sometimes in shrubby undergrowth. Associated trees include Chinkapin Oak (*Quercus muehlenbergii*), Black Oak (*Quercus velutina*), Bur Oak (*Quercus macrocarpa*), Northern Red Oak (*Quercus rubra*), American Hophornbeam (*Ostrya virginiana*), and occasionally Black Walnut (*Juglans nigra*). The species name *purpurinus* refers to the purplish-red coloration of the cap.

The cap is deep red to wine-colored, sometimes with violet tones, fading toward a pale margin. Its surface is finely fuzzy when young and may develop cracks with age. The stem is hollow with a white central pith and white basal mycelium, showing red tones that split to reveal yellow beneath. The pore surface is white to cream, becoming yellow with age; pores are round and do not bruise distinctly, or if so, slightly brown. The flesh is white, sometimes browning faintly in age. Odor is mild; taste may be slightly bitter. The spore print is yellowish.
