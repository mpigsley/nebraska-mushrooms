The Small-Spored Sunset Waxycap (_Hygrocybe acutoconica var. microspora_) is a mushroom with an undetermined ecological role. It's uncertain if it is a decomposer, mycorrhizal, or some other type of mushroom. This mushroom can be found late sprint through fall under Oak and other deciduous trees. _Hygrocybe acutoconica_ is widespread in North America but _H. acutoconica var. microspora_ has only been found east of the Rocky Mountains and is differentiated by its more slimy cap surface and smaller spores. _H. acutoconica_ was originally described from northeast Nebraska in the early 1900s.

The cap is conical to umbonate to flat, slimy to tacky, with colors ranging from yellow to orange to red. It does not bruise black some some other _Hygrocybe sp._. The gills are free from the stem or narrowly attached to it, are yellowish or orangish, and have a slightly waxy texture. It does not have an annulus nor a volva. The spore print is white.
