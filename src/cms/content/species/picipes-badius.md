The Bay Polypore (_Picipes badius_) is a saprobic mushroom that can be found on the deadwood of broadleaf trees. It fruits in the spring and fall.

The cap color is tanish when young, becoming brown, then reddish-brown. The color is most vibrant towards the center of the cap. The cap is generally shaped with a deep depression, becoming funnel-shaped.

The hymenophore consists of tiny, irregularly placed pores. Colored white when young, becoming cream-colored with age.

This mushroom is also called the "Black Footed Polypore" due to its black stem base developed with age.
