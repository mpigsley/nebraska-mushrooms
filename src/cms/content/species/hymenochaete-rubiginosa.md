The Oak Curtain Crust Fungus (_Hymenochaete rubiginosa_) is a common woodland crust fungi that can be found year-round on Oak. The fruiting body can grow as a crust or a shelf depending on what angle it is growing from its substrate.

The shelving caps feature concentric zones of color transitioning from black to brown from the cap attachment to margin. Sometimes the caps appear entirely black.

The hymenophore consists of microscopic pores too small to notice without a hand lens. The surface is rusty colored or tan, is bumpy, and can sometimes present a shiny iridescence. 

A quick field test with dilute KOH or ammonia will turn it black on all surfaces.
