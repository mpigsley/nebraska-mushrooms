The Shield Dapperling (_Lepiota clypeolaria_) is a decomposer that can be found under conifer trees in the summer. This one was found growing under Eastern Red Cedar at Indian Cave State Park in southeastern Nebraska. It can be found growing alone or in small groups in soil, presumably decomposing conifer tree debris. 

The cap is adorned with soft yellow scales, and the scales split more readily towards the margin to reveal a white under surface. The gills are white and free from the stem. The stem is white to yellowish with fluffy veil material attached to all surface besides the apex. The taste is nutty - please don't eat _Lepiotas_... spit it out after a taste! Members of this genus are known to contain deadly toxins. The spore print is white.
