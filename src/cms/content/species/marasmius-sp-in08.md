_Marasmius sp-IN08_ is a decomposer of woodland duff and wood that can be found in association with Oak in the summer. It is closely related to _Marasmius sullivantii_, though this mushroom is distinct enough to be considered its own species. This one has been found multiple times in an Oak/Hickory woodland at Indian Cave State Park in southeastern Nebraska growing from duff and from wood.

The cap is orange with a darker center, smooth textured, and evenly rounded. The gills are shallow with variable attachment (free, adnexed, notched). The stem is elastic with white basal mycelium. The spore print is white.
