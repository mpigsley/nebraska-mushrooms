This mushroom was found growing in a well-decomposed pocket in a fallen broadleaf tree log. Not a typical place to find _Russula_, but why not? _Russula fucosa_ falls within the Shrimp Russula group. Members of this group commonly smell like fish or shrimp, have red caps, and whitish or yellow spore print. This odd specimen was found at Indian Cave State Park in southeastern Nebraska during the summer.
