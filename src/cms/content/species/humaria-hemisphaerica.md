Brown-haired White Cup (_Humaria hemisphaerica_) is a cup fungus that can be found in the summer and fall. It can be found growing in the soil or sometimes growing on fallen wood. It grows alone or in small groups and known to be mycorrhizal with hardwoods.

The outer cup is brownish-colored with noticeable hairs or "eye-lashes" toward the cup margin. It sometimes has a short stem, but otherwise grows without a stem.

An easy field characteristic is the color contrast between the outer and inner parts of the cup, which are brown and white.

It is brittle and usually reaches a width of 2-3 cm (3/4 - 1 1/4 inches).
