The Zoned Gymnopus is a widely distributed gilled mushroom that can be found in the springtime in soil and well decomposed wood. 

It's closely related to the [Oak-Loving Gymnopus](/species/gymnopus-dryophilus-9827/), and can be separated by a few field characteristics:
- Its growth habit on soil or wood rather than leaf litter.
- Yellow gills rather than white.
- Occasonal color zonation on the cap (as compared to solid chestnut color in the Oak-Loving Gymnopus).
- Reddish rhyzomorphs rather than white.
