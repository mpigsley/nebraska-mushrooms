*Helvellosebacina concrescens* is a mycorrhizal fungus that fruits from soil in woodlands in the summer, often attached to the bases of herbaceous stems, usually grasses. It grows singularly to gregariously in shaded areas in forests with broadleaf trees. The genus name combines *Helvella* (referring to the vaguely saddle- or cup-shaped growth forms) and *Sebacina* (the typical genus for this form and niche), and includes species with variable forms ranging from crust-like to upright lobed structures (Oberwinkler et al., 2014).

Fruiting bodies are semi-transparent and cloudy in appearance, often forming upright, lobed, or irregular masses. They arise directly from soil and sometimes appear fused at the base. The texture is soft and gelatinous when fresh. Odor is sweet, bubblegum-like; taste is not distinctive. The spore print is white.
