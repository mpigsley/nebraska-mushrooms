The Veined Shield is a photogenic decomposer of dead deciduous trees and woodland debris in the spring and fall. It can be found mostly distributed in eastern North America, but also has been reported in California. *Pluteus thomsonii* is better considered as "*Pluteus thomsonii group*" as many genetically distinct species have been found in North America alone, hence the provisional name for this specimen, *Pluteus thomsonii-IN03*, which is the third genetically distinct *P. thomsonii*-like species found in Indiana alone... Don't you love the chaos and confusion of North American mycology?

The most distinctive feature of Veined Shield is of course the veined pattern on the cap surface which is highly variable and always a fun find. Doesn't nature have the most bizarre patterns? The cap is evenly rounded to flat in shape with radially aligned lines at the margin.

The gills are free from the stem and start out white colored when young becoming pink with age. The stem is even and doesn't possess an annulus nor a volva. The spore print is pink, which can be seen on the stem in the following photo.
