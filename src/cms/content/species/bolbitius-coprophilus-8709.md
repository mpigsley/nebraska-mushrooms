The Dung-Loving Bolbitius is a widespread gilled mushroom that grows on... (you guessed it!) dung, compost, and other nitrogen-rich organic substrates. It can be found growing alone or in groups (singular or gregarious). Its gills are slightly attached to the stem (acutely adnexed). A. coprophilus has a brownish spore print (dull cinnamon brown).
