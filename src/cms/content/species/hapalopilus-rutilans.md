The Tender Nesting Polypore (_Hapalopilus rutilans_) is a decomposer of wood which is common on fallen Hickory (_Carya sp._). It can be found from the spring through the fall. The cap is colored orangish to brownish and does not have a stem (sessile). There are angular pores underneath the cap. A distinctive feature of this mushroom is the vivid purple color that is displayed when a drop of KOH or Ammonia is applied on the surface (both are strong chemical bases that change the pigmentation).

Also known as _Hapalopilus nidulans_.

#### Ethnomycology

Due to this mushroom's vibrant colors in combination with chemicals, it is a common source of pigment for dying natural fibers (yarn, thread, etc.) making it a valuable mushroom for mycocrafting. [(Bloom & Dye, 2024)](https://mushroomcoloratlas.com/mushroom/hapalopilus_nidulans/)
