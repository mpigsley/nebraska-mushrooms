Fungi (kingdom [*Fungi*](/taxa/fungi)) and slime molds (Phylum [*Myxomycota*](/taxa/myxomycota) in kingdom [_Porotozoa_](/taxa/protozoa)) are separate lineages for their similar functions as decomposers and nutrient recyclers in ecosystems. Both produce spore-bearing structures for reproduction and appear on soil, wood, and organic matter.
