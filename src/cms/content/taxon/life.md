Fungi (kingdom *Fungi*) and slime molds (Phylum *Mycetozoa* in kingdom _Porotozoa_) are separate lineages for their similar functions as decomposers and nutrient recyclers in ecosystems. Both produce spore-bearing structures for reproduction and appear on soil, wood, organic matter. Some have even adapted to decompose synthetic plastic, which have only been on this planet since the birth of the modern plastic industry in 1907. Fungi grow from hidden mycelium into mushrooms, crusts, or brackets. Slime molds begin as individual mobile plasmodia and join together in large groups to form delicate sporangia.
