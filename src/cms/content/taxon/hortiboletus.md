The genus name _Hortiboletus_ comes from the Latin word `Hortus` meaning 'garden', so "Garden Bolete". Though members of this genus will often show up in gardens, not exclusively so, as species can be found in woodland and grassy settings as well.

Commonly, red dots can be found on context of the stipe base (Vizzini, 2015)
