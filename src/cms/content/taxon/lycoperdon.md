_Lycoperdon_ is a genus of puffball mushrooms that grow from soil and wood. The name literally means "wolf's flatulence"... Possibly suggestive of its massive release of spores through a central apical pore... I'll stop there and allow the reader's imagination to draw the connections.

On a more serious note, the aggressive spore strategy from this genus has been linked to a disease called `Lycoperdonosis` which is pneumonia-like symptoms from inhaling massive amounts of spores (Henriksen, 1976).

Another common puffball that grows on dead wood, the Pear-Shaped Puffball ([_Apioperdon pyriforme_](/species/apioperdon-pyriforme)), was once in this genus until it was separated based on genetic differences.
