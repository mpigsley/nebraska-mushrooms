Genus _Lepiota_, the `Dapperlings`, is composed of small and large agaric mushrooms with free gills, white spore prints, and usually have some distinctive ornamentation on the top of the cap such as scales, woolly veil tissue, or powdery material. They are common in the spring time and are decomposers of woodland debris and soil. Some members of this genus produce `Amatoxins` (named after [_Amanita_](/taxa/amanita)) which are among some of the most deadly poisonous mycotoxins produced by nature. Do not eat _Lepiotas_!
