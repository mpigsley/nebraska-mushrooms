The genus _Russula_ is one of the largest and most diverse groups of mushrooms. Commonly called `Brittlegills`, these mushrooms are exceptionally fragile, and are among of the first to break apart into innumerable pieces in the foray collection basket. They are mycorrhizal and generally associate with Oak or Pine and are found in the spring or fall. The spore print is white to cream to yellow.
