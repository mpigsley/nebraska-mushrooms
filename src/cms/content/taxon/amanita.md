_Amanita_ is a genus of gilled mushrooms that have white or light colored spores, free gills, a volva, and sometimes an annulus.

_Amanitas_ should be avoided by the typical mushroom hunter. The genus has some members that produce deadly toxins like [Isoxazole Derivatives](https://namyco.org/interests/toxicology/mushroom-poisoning-syndromes/#muscimol) and [Amatoxins](https://namyco.org/interests/toxicology/mushroom-poisoning-syndromes/#amatoxin). Sometimes the distinction of edible or deadly can come down to whether the wind or a squirrel carried the annulus away. When in doubt, throw it out. Mushroom hunting safety includes learning about poisonous species. Please read more about edibility [here](/articles/concerning-wild-mushroom-edibility/).
