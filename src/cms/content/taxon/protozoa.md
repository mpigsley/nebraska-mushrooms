_Protozoa_ is a broad historical grouping of single-celled eukaryotes, now used informally to describe several unrelated lineages with animal-like behaviors. Among them, slime molds in the phylum *Myxomycota* stand out for their spore-bearing fruiting bodies and dramatic life cycles. These organisms occur on decaying logs, leaf litter, and other damp substrates, especially in shaded forests after rain.

Myxomycetes (aka slime molds) begin as free-living amoeboid cells that merge into visible, creeping plasmodia—often brightly colored and veined. When conditions trigger reproduction, they form sporangia (spore producing structures) that resemble tiny pins, nets, or coral structures. These fruiting bodies are short-lived but can appear in large numbers. They are generally white small and easily go unnoticed.
