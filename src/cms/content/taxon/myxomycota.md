*Myxomycota* is a group of slime molds that live in damp forest litter, logs, and soil, especially after rain. Though not fungi, they form similar spore-producing structures. They begin as microscopic amoeba-like cells that merge into a visible, often brightly colored slime stage called a plasmodium. This stage creeps over surfaces before forming tiny, fragile sporangia—often shaped like balls, nets, or upright clusters. These fruiting bodies are short-lived and can be quite striking in form and colorful.
