_Psathyrella_ is a genus of gilled mushrooms commonly referred to as "Brittle Stems". As the name suggests, the stems are quite brittle and can snap characteristically when bent. The caps are also brittle and commonly break apart into radial divisions. Commonly found in spring. The spores are dark brown to black. Gills are adnexed to adnate, starting pinkish or grayish later turning dark from mature spores.
