The Fiber Caps (genus _Inocybe_) are a diverse group of mycorrhizal mushrooms that can be found in woodland settings. This is a large genus, and many in North America have not yet been documented. _Inocybes_ form caps with fibers that radiate from the center to the margin and are often found splitting at the margin. They usually have distinct smells, scents like musty, spermatic, green corn, and floral.

Members of these genus are known to be toxic. The toxin in question called **muscarine**. Please review the list of symptoms below.

> The symptoms usually occur within 15-30 minutes of ingestion, and are focused on the involuntary nervous system. They include excessive salivation, sweating, tears, lactation (in pregnant women), plus severe vomiting and diarrhea. These symptoms may be accompanied by visual disturbances, irregular pulse, decreased blood pressure, and difficulty breathing. Victims normally recover within 24 hours, but severe cases may result in death due to respiratory failure. Atropine is a specific antidote, but must be administered by a physician. Dogs are particularly susceptible to the toxin muscarine. [(Beug, 2024)](https://namyco.org/interests/toxicology/mushroom-poisoning-syndromes/#muscarine)

If you or someone you know has been poisoned by consuming wild mushrooms, call 9-1-1 and get the individual medical attention IMMEDIATELY. Afterwards, please [report poisonings](https://namyco.org/interests/toxicology/report-a-poisoning/) to the North American Mycological Association to contribute to our understanding of wild mushroom safety.
