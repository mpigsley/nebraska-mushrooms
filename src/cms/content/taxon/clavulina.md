*Clavulina* is a genus of coral fungi recognized for its white to pale-colored fruiting bodies that range from compact, club-like forms to intricately branched, antler-like, or coral-like structures. Species in this group are terrestrial and mycorrhizal, commonly found on the ground in mixed hardwood or coniferous forests. In Nebraska, both sparsely branched and elaborately coralloid forms have been observed.
