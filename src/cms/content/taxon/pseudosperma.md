_Pseudosperma_ is a genus of ground-dwelling mushrooms that live in partnership with trees, forming mycorrhizal relationships where both organisms share nutrients. These mushrooms can be found in forests across North America and beyond, often in late summer and fall. They were once grouped under _Inocybe_, but DNA studies and microscopic features showed enough differences to give them their own genus (Matheny et al., 2020). They tend to grow under hardwoods or conifers and are typically small to medium in size.

Most _Pseudosperma_ mushrooms have dry, dull-colored caps in shades of brown, yellow-brown, or tan. A common feature is a `rivulose` cap surface — meaning it often has fine cracks or lines that give it a weathered look. The gills are attached to the stem and turn brown with age. The stem is usually fibrous and lacks a ring. These mushrooms don’t have a strong smell like other _Inocyboids_. The spore print is brown.
