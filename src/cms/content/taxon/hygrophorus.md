*Hygrophorus*, commonly known as Woodwaxes, is a genus of woodland mushrooms that appear in fall in woodland settings. These fungi are terrestrial and mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with trees. The fruiting bodies are recognized by their waxy, thick, widely spaced gills that run down the stem (decurrent), and their smooth, often sticky caps. They produce white spore prints.
