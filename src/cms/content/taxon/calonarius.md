The genus _Calonarius_ was once considered to be a subsection of _Cortinarius_; however, in 2022 genetic testing placed this group into its own genus in _Cortinaceae_. This genus is exclusively found in the Northern Hemisphere and associates with trees in the _Fagaceae_, i.e. Oaks, Beech, etc. The Latin was created by a combination of its original section _Calochroi_ (meaning "beautiful skin") and the genus _Cortinarius_.

The fruiting bodies are medium to large, typically brightly colored, and often with a marginate stipe base (the stem base has a bulb with an angular ridge marking the attachment of the universal veil). The pileus (cap) is generally viscid, slimy, or tacky and the stem is dry. Members of this genus have a brown spore print.
