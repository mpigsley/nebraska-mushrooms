_Lycoperdaceae_ is a sequestrate or gasteroid family, meaning instead of producing spores on external structures like gills, spores are produced inside the fruiting body, producing a ball-like shape.

Morphology: The outside (protective case) is called the 'Peridium' and the inside (spore-producing) is called the 'Gleba'.
