_Atheniella_ is a genus of small, brightly colored, _Mycena_-like agarics separated from _Mycena_ in 2012. These tiny mushrooms grow on plant debris and duff (leaves, twigs, etc.). The name _Atheniella_ comes from the Greek goddess Athena and was spelled as such to "achieve phonetic harmony and uniqueness with an allegorical allusion to mythical Athena (beauty, spear, and shield) and her ancient Mycenaean origins."

__Cap__ conical, bell-shaped, convex, or sometimes papillate and brightly colored (red, orange, yellow, or white). 

__Stem__ thin and fragile, with coarse fibrils at the base, and colored white, pink, orange or yellow. 

__Gills__ attached to the stem with a decurrent tooth, reddish, pinkish, creamy, or white.

__Spore Color__ white.
