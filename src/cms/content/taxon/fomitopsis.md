_Fomitopsis_ is a genus of polypores typically found on the dead wood of conifers and broadleaf trees. These fungi produce fuiting bodies that are tough to woody when dry. The genus name _Fomitopsis_ means “resembling _Fomes_,” referring to its morphological similarity. Fruiting bodies are most commonly observed from spring through fall in temperate woodlands.
