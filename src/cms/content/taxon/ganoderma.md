*Ganoderma* is a widespread genus of wood-decomposing polypores that fruit from spring through fall on stumps, buried roots, and the bases of living or dead trees. Species form thick, woody fruiting bodies that are shelf-like or hoof-shaped, either sessile or with a central stalk. Some are annual, while others are perennial and regrow over multiple seasons. Caps often show concentric zones and may be dull or varnished. The spore print is brown.
